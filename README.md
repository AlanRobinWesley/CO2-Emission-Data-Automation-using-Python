# CO2-Emission-Data-Automation-using-Python
Download the data file from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata. This dataset contains CO2 and GHG emissions for countries since 1750 until 2017. The file format is a CSV file, I used pythons pandas, matplotlib, plotly, json, geojson, and seaborn to represent the data visually. I have used plotly express to represent my graphs, I have used plotly to save the graphs in a HTML format, so users can access it from any local host. The data file has four columns named Country, ISO code, Year of the emission, and Value in tones. I have used 8 graphs to represents the graphs much more precise. I have used heatmaps, so it is easy to find the country which has emitted the most amount of CO2 every year. I have also included a chart with a map format, it helps user to understand the emission by country, when you hover over the maps. I used the offline format, so graphs can opened from anywhere and not local server.
